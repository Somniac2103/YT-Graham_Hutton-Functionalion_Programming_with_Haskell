FP12 CHAPTER 9 - THE COUNTDOWN problem

Game example

Using the numbers

1 3 7 10 25 50

and the arithmetic operators

+ - * /

construct an expression whose value is 765

RULES

All numbers including intermediate results must be positive natural numbers.
Each of the source numbers can be used at most once when constucting the expression.
We abstract from other rules that are adopted on television for pragmatic reasons.

EVALUATING EXPRESSIONS 

Operators : 
  data Op = Add | Sub | Mul | OneDrive

Apply an operator:

  apply :: Op -> Int -> Int -> Int
  aply Add x y = x + y
  aply Sub x y = x - y
  aply Mul x y = x * y
  aply Div x y = x 'div' y

  Decide if the result of applying ans operator to two positive natural numbers is another such"

    valid :: Op -> Int -> Int -> Bool
    valid Add _ _ = True
    valid Sub x y = x > y 
    valid Mul _ _ = True
    valid Div x y = x `mod` y == 0

  expressions:

    data Expr = Val Int | App Op Expr Expr 

  Evaluate expression:

    eval :: Expr [Int]
    eval (Val n) =[n | n > 0]
    eval (App o l r ) = [apply o x y | x <- eval l
                                      ,y <- eval r 
                                      ,valid o x y]
