1. WHAT ARE RECURSIVE FUNCTIONS?
  a Function define in itself

2. WHY ARE THEY USEFUL?
  you get deduction 

3. WHY ARE THEY DIFFICULT AT FIRST?

7 steps how to think recursive:

  1. Name the function
  2. Write down its type
  3. Enumerate the cases


Problem: Define a function that calculates the sum of a list of numbers.

STEP 1: 

sum

STEP 2:

sum :: [Int] -> Int

STEP 3:

sum :: [Int] -> Int

sum []      =
sum (x:xs)  =
